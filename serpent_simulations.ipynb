I just don't think that the buckling search works in Serpent. I decreased the geometric buckling, attempting to reach a value of 1.31e-3, starting from 3.52e-3 for the 57 cm radius reactor but didn't get there...I only got down to 1.90e-3 with the reactor radius of 74 cm.

Typically, even at assembly level we use reflective boundary conditions at first to isolate the assembly from the rest of the reactor core. Treating the current level this way yields a $k_{inf}$ of sorts and a spectrum that we can call an infinite medium spectrum because of the reflective conditions. However, we want to determine a criticality spectrum. A critical system can be realized in a few ways. One way would be to add some amount of absorber (if $k_{inf}>1$; negative absorber if the system is sub-critical). However, a more physically realistic way is to add leakage; e.g. if the reactor core is critical but one piece's $k_{inf}$ is subcritical, then there will be neat leakage into that component to balance.\n",

Similarly, spatially-varying pin-cell fluxes can be homogenized by simple cell averaging (e.g. integrate cell flux over cell volume and then divide by cell volume) to create space indepenent cell average fluxes. Micro-group cell-averaged fluxes are then used to collapse cell-averaged micro-group cross sections into few-group, assembly-averaged cross sections using equation 17.3.1.2.
