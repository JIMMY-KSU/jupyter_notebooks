    "- `print`, `p`: print the value of a variable\n",
    "- `list`, `l`: list the code lines around the current line\n",
    "- `up`: move a frame up the stack trace\n",
    "- `down`: move a frame down the stack trace\n",
    "- `backtrace`, `bt`: list all the frames in the stack (e.g. from main all the way down through all the subroutine calls)\n",
    "- `next`, `n`: move to the next line of code, stepping over any subroutine calls\n",
    "- `step`, `s`: similar to next, but will step into subroutine calls (even ones you might not expect like `vector::operator[]`, e.g. vector element access)\n",
    "- `continue`, `c`: continue program execution until hitting the next breakpoint or until program execution finishes (whichever comes first)\n",
    "\n",
    "### gdb\n",
    "\n",
    "- `break`, `b`: tell the debugger to halt execution at a given point. Can be at the beginning of a method call, e.g. `break GroupDiffusion::computeQpResidual`, or a particular line of code, e.g. `break Kernel.C:50`\n",
    "- `finish`: continue execution until the current frame or subroutine returns to the calling frame and print the returned value\n",
    "- `return`: prematurely return from the current frame to the calling frame. Can optionally supply a value that you want the prematurely exiting frame to return\n",
    "- `info <subcommand>`: get info about a particular subcommand. Most common:\n",
    "- `info break`: get information about breakpoints\n",
    "- `run`, `r`: run the program from the beginning\n",
    "- `disable <breakpoint #>`: disable the supplied breakpoint\n",
    "- `enable <breakpoint #>`: enable the supplied breakpoint\n",
    "- `delete <breakpoint #>`, `d <breapoint #>`: delete the supplied breakpoint\n",
