    "> \"Practical limiations on computer storage and execution time generally prohibit the explicit modeling of each fuel pin in a LWR. Instead 'equivalent' few-group diffusion-theory parameters are determined for relatively large homogeneous regions often consisting of entire fuel assemblies in the radial plane. With these parameters in hand, global solutions are computed for this homogenized-assembly representation of the reactor. Solution of this problem using traditional finite-difference techniques requires a large number of mesh points in orrder to represent accurately the spatial variation of the neutron flux. The computational expense associated with these calculations motivated the early development of less rigorous, yet more computationally efficient techniques oriented towards the determination of the flux averaged over each homogeneous region or 'node'. This class of methods thus became known as nodal methods, and the FLARE model developed in 1964 is representative of the first generation of these schemes.\"\n"
