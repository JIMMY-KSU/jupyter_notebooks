    "> \"Practical limiations on computer storage and execution time generally prohibit the explicit modeling of each fuel pin in a LWR. Instead 'equivalent' few-group diffusion-theory parameters are determined for relatively large homogeneous regions often consisting of entire fuel assemblies in the radial plane. With these parameters in hand, global solutions are computed for this homogenized-assembly representation of the reactor. Solution of this problem using traditional finite-difference techniques requires a large number of mesh points in orrder to represent accurately the spatial variation of the neutron flux. The computational expense associated with these calculations motivated the early development of less rigorous, yet more computationally efficient techniques oriented towards the determination of the flux averaged over each homogeneous region or 'node'. This class of methods thus became known as nodal methods, and the FLARE model developed in 1964 is representative of the first generation of these schemes.\"\n"

However, a lot of the user objects are not currently block restrictable which raises errors in my simulation becuase the precursors don't just live on one block.

A vector space is a collection of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied (\"scaled\") by numbers, called scalars in this context. A vector space over a (scalar) field F is a set V together with two operations that satisfy eight axioms. Elements of V are commonly called vectors. Elements of F are commonly called scalars (because they can *scale* vectors). In the axioms on Wikipedia's page, **u**, **v**, and **w** are abitrary vectors in _V_ and _a_ and _b_ are scalars in _F_. The most common _F_ fields in engineering are the field of real numbers **R** and the field of complex numbers **C**. The corresponding vector fields are the <i>real vector space</i> and <i>complex vector space</i> respectively. The general definition of a vector space allows scalars to be elements of any fixed field _F_. The notion is then known as an <i>F-vector space</i> or a <i>vector space over F</i>.\n",

    "(Wikipedia function): Collections of functions with the same domain and codomain are called function spaces, the properties of which are studied in such mathematical disciplines as real analysis, complex analysis, and functional analysis. The function's codomain doesn't have to be the same as the function's set of outputs. There are three pieces that make up a function in modern mathematics: 1) the set of possible inputs (_domain_), 2) a set containing the set of outputs and possibly additional elements (_codomain_), and 3) the set of all input-output pairs called the function's _graph_. Sometimes _range_ is used to refer to the codomain, but more commonly it's used to refer to the set of possible function outputs, also known as the _image_. My favorite example of a function definition in which the image doesn't match the codomain is f(x) = x^2 where we define both the domain and the codomain to be the set of real numbers. Here the image/range is 0 and all positive real numbers while the codomain is all real numbers.\n",

Two mathematical objects are isomorphic if an isomorphism exists between them.... For most algebraic structures, including groups and rings, a homomorphism is an isomorphism if and only if it is bijective (i.e. both injective and surjective). Injective means that every element of the codomain is mapped to by at most one element of the domain. E.g. an element in the codomain coupld be mapped to by one or zero elements in the domain. If we defined X and Y to be the sets of all real numbers than, the mapping f(x) = x^2 is not injective because for instance both x = 1 and x = -1 map to +1. Surjective means that every element of the codomain is mapped to by at least one element of the domain. x^2 is not surjective either because none of the negative real numbers can be mapped to by the elements of X. Now f(x) = x is both injective and surjective, and is thus bijective.\n",

    "Thinking with David Andrs about block restriction of `ElementLoopObject`. `AEFVKernel` calls a user object of type `InternalSideFluxBase`. `AEFVBC` calls a user object of type `BoundaryFluxBase`. In `BoundaryFluxBase` for example, the `getFlux` method is implemented. However, it's the children of `BoundaryFluxBase` that define the calcFlux method. For `AEFVFreeOutflowBoundaryFlux`, calcFlux takes uvec1 and dwave as arguments. AEFVBC passes the material property `u` as the uvec argument to calcFlux. `uvec` represents the values of the variable at the faces. So essentially the material property is for holding the variable value at faces while the variable value at the element/cell center is held by the actual nonlinear coupled variable. In the material class, the material property (e.g. variable value at cell faces) is calculated using the variable value at the element center and a provided user object for slope limiting, e.g. required parameters for the material (AEFVMaterial) are: `addRequiredCoupledVar(\"u\"...)` and `addRequiredParam<UserObjectName>(\"slope_limiting\"...)`, where the user object is of type `SlopeLimitingBase` which itself inherits from `ElementLoopObject`.\n",

    "Here's how I interpret the above: in Serpent, they only model one assembly, and they assume that have an inifinite array of such fuel assemblies, e.g. they impose reflective or periodic boundary conditions on the edges of the single fuel assembly that they are modeling, creating in effect an *inifinite* reactor. If such is the model case, then all the language in the enumerated list makes sense. However, what if the Serpent model is of the *entire core* such that reflective/periodic boundary conditions are not chosen? Then is what Jakko calls $k_{inf}$ really $k_{inf}$? I don't think so.\n",

    "I would not describe $B_n^2$ in it's above form as independent of either geometry or materials, e.g. I would not call it either geometric or material buckling alone. Clearly there's dependence on material group constants. But there's also dependence on $k$, which will be a function of the reactor dimensions. I don't know, it's enough to make my head spin I suppose. I've always interpreted things straight from the differential equations; there's a clear mathematical context there. So this sentence from Stammler (pg. 357) \"We have two sets of eigenvalues, of which the largest material buckling $B_1^2$, and the smallest geometric buckling $B_{111}^2$, are the only ones with egenvectors (spectrum and shape) that are realizable by themselves\" makes no sense to me. Where in the world are two sets of eigenvalues coming from?? There's only one differential equation!! The buckling eigenvalue above $B_n^2$ is a function entirely of the governing equation boundary conditions, e.g. the only parameters appearing inside of it are geometric."
